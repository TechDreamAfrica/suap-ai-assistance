# App Icon Instructions

#

# For the APK build to work properly, you need to add the following files to the assets folder:

#

# 1. icon.png - App icon (512x512 pixels recommended)

# - Should be a square image with the app logo

# - PNG format with transparent background

# - Contains "SUA PA LMS" or mathematical symbols

#

# 2. splash.png - Splash screen (1080x1920 pixels recommended)

# - Welcome screen shown when app starts

# - Should include app name and logo

# - PNG format

#

# For now, you can use any square PNG image as icon.png and any rectangular image as splash.png

# The APK will build without these files, but it's recommended to add them for a professional look.

#

# Temporary solution: The APK builder will use default Flet icons if these files are missing.
